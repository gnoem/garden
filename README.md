## todo

- [ ] loading icon
- [ ] button to pause/play animations
- [ ] arrow buttons to toggle theme
- [x] figure out if separate theme context is really necessary? could also just create a custom hook and maybe put it in RenderContext since they're somewhat related/in[ ] terdependent already
- [ ] get rid of transformObject its stupid
- [ ] add css for different themes
- [ ] convert water to ts
- [ ] clean up lib
- [ ] link themes to url paths??
